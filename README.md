# it-support-scripts
A collection of Python and Bash scripts for various IT support tasks, including monitoring, user management, and more.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system before running the scripts:

- **Python 3.x** (for Python scripts)
- **Bash** (for Bash scripts)
- **pip3** (Python package installer)
- **smtplib** (for email notifications in Python scripts)
- **psutil** (for system health monitoring)

You can install `psutil` using pip:
```bash
pip3 install psutil
```
### Installation
 **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webpro255/it-support-scripts.git
   cd it-support-scripts
   ```
**Navigate to the respective script folder:**
   ```bash
   cd server_health_monitor  # Example for the server health monitor script
   ```
**Install required Python packages:**
  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
### Configuration

Some scripts require configuration before they can be used.

Several scripts in this repository also use positional parameters to accept arguments. Positional parameters are placeholders in the script that are replaced by actual values provided when the script is executed. This allows the scripts to be flexible and reusable for different inputs.

### Positional Parameters

- **$1**: Represents the first argument passed to the script.
- **$2**: Represents the second argument passed to the script.
- **$3**: Represents the third argument passed to the script, and so on.
